Knife Fight was founded in 2003 as a chance to give Portland-based college players a chance to team up
with college-season rivals. Now heading into the 2011 season, Knife Fight is looking for young players who 
want to play high-level ultimate over the summer, and welcomes older players who want to help improve the pool of mens' club talent in Portland.

__Knife Fight 2011__ has taken up the challenge to fill a dual role in the Portland club scene. In essence, we don't believe that building and fielding the strongest club team possible precludes us from providing a place where young Portland ultimate players can work  hard on developing club-level skills.
