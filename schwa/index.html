<h4>About Schwa | <a href="roster">View Roster</a></h4>

<p>This year marks Schwa’s return to the national stage after six long years and the team couldn’t be more excited! After forming in 1996, Schwa went to Nationals in nine of its first ten seasons and played for the championship in three of those appearances, helping establish the Northwest as the most formidable region in the women’s division. The last few years have seen a period of growth and renewal, with mostly new names gracing the Schwa roster. Not only the dedication of our players and our strategist, Danny Quarrell, but also the tenacity and skills of all of our Northwest neighbors, have helped us grow into the team we are today. We are proud to represent the name Schwa, Oregon, and the Pacific Northwest, and are looking forward to leaving it ALL on the fields in Sarasota.</p>
