Burnside is entering their third campaign, aiming for a bid to Nationals after falling short in the game to go in 2010. Masters is open to any player that will turn 33 or older in this calendar year. We play Masters only pickup every weekend throughout the year, and then buckle down for actual practices in the weeks before tournaments.

We will be attending Solstice, Open Sectionals and Masters Regionals as well as putting on our own Masters tournament.
